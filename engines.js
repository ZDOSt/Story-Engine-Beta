    rule: a grab/catch/hold is hostilePhysicalIntent only when it explicitly includes harm, attack, violent restraint, pinning, dragging, forced movement, twisting/crushing, choking, domination, or preventing bodily action by force
    rule: return false for grabbing/catching/holding an NPC's wrist, arm, shoulder, sleeve, cloak, or clothing only to stop/delay/get attention/block departure/contest immediate movement, unless explicit harm, attack, violent restraint, pinning, dragging, forced movement, twisting/crushing, choking, domination, or bodily injury is also stated

    rule: examples include snatching a scroll from under an NPC's hand, taking a guarded purse, forcing past a guard through a doorway, wrenching an object away, pushing into a protected space, or catching/holding an NPC's wrist/arm/sleeve only to stop them leaving or force attention
    rule: return false if classifyHostilePhysicalIntent=true
    rule: return false for casual proximity, ordinary movement, normal item handling, conversation, non-forceful requests, pure social pressure, or any no-stakes action

    BenefitedObservers = THIRD-PARTY LIVING entities present in scene, not ActionTargets and not OppTargets.NPC, whose stakes materially improve as a result of {{user}}'s actions, as per DEF.STAKES. Protective/rescue contact with an ally, shielding them, pulling/pushing them out of danger, or standing between them and harm makes them BenefitedObservers when {{user}} is not contesting their will, harming them, restraining them, or making them the main opposed challenge. Example: {{user}} pushes a woman out of danger and stands between her and a harasser. Harasser = ActionTargets and OppTargets.NPC; woman = BenefitedObservers.
    HarmedObservers = THIRD-PARTY LIVING entities present in scene, not ActionTargets and not OppTargets.NPC, whose stakes materially worsen as a result of {{user}}'s actions, as per DEF.STAKES. This requires an explicit material stake, relationship, duty, protection role, authority role, or similar; mere witnessing alone is not enough. Example: {{user}} hurts an NPC while that NPC's father witnesses it. Hurt NPC = ActionTargets and OppTargets.NPC; witnessing father = HarmedObservers.
    rule: if hasStakes=N, OppTargets.NPC must be [(none)] unless a hard intimacy gate rule forces stakes

    rule: protective/rescue movement of an ally does not make that ally ActionTargets unless {{user}} contests their will, harms them, restrains them, or makes them the main opposed challenge
    rule: ActionTargets, OppTargets.NPC, BenefitedObservers, and HarmedObservers are mutually exclusive observer categories except that direct ActionTargets may also be OppTargets.NPC when they are the resisting/opposing party

    rule: if explicit means is negative social interaction such as bluff, deception, intimidation, coercion, threat, blackmail, manipulation, interrogation, humiliation, or forced submission against a living opposing target, USER=CHA and OPP=MND
    rule: if OppTargets.NPC contains an opposing entity, determine opposing stat by applying DEF.STATS to that first OppTargets.NPC entity's resistance to {{user}}'s explicit means or finalGoal
