    rule: romantic, flirtatious, affectionate, suggestive, sexual, or intimate talk/contact is not a special roll category by itself. Describe the finalGoal plainly without using an intimacy gate label.

    rule: return false for grabbing/catching/holding an NPC's wrist, arm, shoulder, sleeve, cloak, or clothing only to stop/delay/get attention/block departure/contest immediate movement, unless explicit harm, attack, violent restraint, pinning, dragging, forced movement, twisting/crushing, choking, domination, or bodily injury is also stated
    rule: return false for taking, grabbing, pulling, snatching, opening, moving, or contesting an object/possession/space/access point, even when an NPC opposes it, unless {{user}} also attacks, harms, violently restrains, pins, shoves, drags, or controls the NPC's body

    rule: return true only if {{user}} uses forceful physical action to contest an NPC's possession, guarded object, immediate personal space, path, access, departure, or body-adjacent boundary while that living NPC has stakes and opposes/resists
    rule: examples include snatching a scroll from under an NPC's hand, taking a guarded purse, forcing past a guard through a doorway, wrenching an object away, pushing into a protected space, or catching/holding an NPC's wrist/arm/sleeve only to stop them leaving or force attention
    rule: return false if classifyHostilePhysicalIntent=true
    rule: return false for casual proximity, ordinary movement, normal item handling, conversation, non-forceful requests, pure social pressure, or any no-stakes action

    OppTargets.ENV = NON-LIVING environmental or terrain feature, hazard, object, or other obstacle directly obstructing {{user}}'s actions
    BenefitedObservers = THIRD-PARTY LIVING entities present in scene, not ActionTargets and not OppTargets.NPC, whose stakes materially improve as a result of {{user}}'s actions, as per DEF.STAKES. Protective/rescue contact with an ally, shielding them, pulling/pushing them out of danger, or standing between them and harm makes them BenefitedObservers when {{user}} is not contesting their will, harming them, restraining them, or making them the main opposed challenge. Example: {{user}} pushes a woman out of danger and stands between her and a harasser. Harasser = ActionTargets and OppTargets.NPC; woman = BenefitedObservers.
    HarmedObservers = THIRD-PARTY LIVING entities present in scene, not ActionTargets and not OppTargets.NPC, whose stakes materially worsen as a result of {{user}}'s actions, as per DEF.STAKES. This requires an explicit material stake, relationship, duty, protection role, authority role, or similar; mere witnessing alone is not enough. Example: {{user}} hurts an NPC while that NPC's father witnesses it. Hurt NPC = ActionTargets and OppTargets.NPC; witnessing father = HarmedObservers.
    rule: identify hostilesInScene.NPC before OppTargets.NPC; then identify which of those, if any, directly oppose {{user}}'s current action
    rule: hostilesInScene.NPC is a scene-level hostile pool only; it does not create relationship changes, rolls, NPCInScene entries, or OppTargets.NPC by itself
    rule: hostilesInScene.NPC may include hostile enemies threatening {{user}}, companions, protected NPCs, bystanders, or the scene generally, as long as they are established and present
    rule: hostilesInScene.NPC must be established by assistant narration, tracker, character/scenario/lore context, or initial test setup; do not create a hostile from the latest user input alone
    rule: hostilesInScene.NPC excludes neutral/friendly NPCs, absent/offscreen entities, defeated/incapacitated entities no longer posing danger, and non-living hazards or obstacles
    rule: if hasStakes=N, OppTargets.NPC must be [(none)]
    rule: a direct ActionTarget can also be OppTargets.NPC only when that target's stakes are meaningfully contested or resisted
    rule: protective/rescue movement of an ally does not make that ally ActionTargets unless {{user}} contests their will, harms them, restrains them, or makes them the main opposed challenge
    rule: ActionTargets, OppTargets.NPC, BenefitedObservers, and HarmedObservers are mutually exclusive observer categories except that direct ActionTargets may also be OppTargets.NPC when they are the resisting/opposing party

    rule: return Y only if the current user input explicitly violates, ignores, or pressures past a clear refusal, stated boundary, withdrawal, fear, incapacitation, explicitly established lack of consent, or prior denial from this specific NPC.
    rule: return Y for coercion, threats, force, unwanted restraint/contact after refusal, repeated pressure after refusal, humiliation, blackmail, or ignoring a clear stop/no.
    rule: return N for flirting, teasing, romantic talk, asking permission, accepting or reciprocating NPC-initiated flirtation/intimacy, or backing off/respecting a boundary.
    rule: return N when consent/refusal is merely uncertain, unstated, or left to ordinary scene interpretation. Do not turn ordinary flirting, teasing, kissing, embracing, or romantic/sexual proposals into mechanics without an explicit boundary violation.
    else -> N

  hasStakes(input, finalGoal, challenge, targets, boundaryViolationExplicit, context):
    policy: LOCKED, EXPLICIT-ONLY
    rule: romantic, flirtatious, affectionate, suggestive, sexual, or intimate conversation/proposals/contact are not stakes by themselves.
    rule: if boundaryViolationExplicit=Y, evaluate stakes normally under DEF.STAKES; boundary violation usually affects autonomy, trust, safety, or social standing.
    rule: return Y if success or failure of finalGoal or explicit challenge could affect {{user}} or NPC's stakes, as per DEF.STAKES
    else -> N

  actionCount(input, challenge):
    policy: LOCKED, EXPLICIT-ONLY, MAX 3 ACTIONS
    rule: every resolved action has at least one action marker
    rule: non-combat actions return exactly one action marker: [a1]
    rule: combat sequences may return up to three action markers
    rule: do not count setup, movement, repositioning, defense, recovery, or non-attack flavor as additional actions
    rule: each individual combat attack/effect within a sequence counts as one action, including physical attacks, spells, status effects, or mixed sequences
    rule: return one action marker per attack: [a1], [a1,a2], or [a1,a2,a3]

    rule: use finalGoal only if no distinct stakes-bearing challenge exists
    rule: if finalGoal relies heavily on a specific enabling action (e.g., a physical feat to intimidate, or clearing an obstacle to dodge), determine USER stat based strictly on that enabling challenge
    rule: if {{user}} uses deliberate mental/supernatural exertion to affect a living target's bodily functions or physical state (paralysis, poison, blindness, forced sleep, pain, muscle lock, disease, transmutation, bodily binding), USER=MND and OPP=PHY
    rule: if magic or a substance creates a non-living environmental hazard/obstacle instead of directly contesting a living target, put the hazard/obstacle in OppTargets.ENV and use OPP=ENV unless a living target explicitly resists the effect
    rule: if explicit means is positive social interaction such as persuasion, negotiation, diplomacy, bargaining, reconciliation, reassurance, or good-faith appeal against a living opposing target, USER=CHA and OPP=CHA
    rule: if explicit means is negative social interaction such as bluff, deception, intimidation, coercion, threat, blackmail, manipulation, interrogation, humiliation, or forced submission against a living opposing target, USER=CHA and OPP=MND
    rule: if OppTargets.NPC contains an opposing entity, determine opposing stat by applying DEF.STATS to that first OppTargets.NPC entity's resistance to {{user}}'s explicit means or finalGoal
    rule: OPP=ENV is valid only for NON-LIVING opposition in OppTargets.ENV
    rule: if a living ActionTarget is the stakes-bearing resisting/contested target, include that target in OppTargets.NPC and use a living opposing stat, never ENV

      Trained = at least comparable to a trained and capable professional or dangerous lesser threat; examples include a city guard, soldier, adventurer, orc, ogre, or competent lesser monster
      Elite = clearly beyond ordinary trained professionals or lesser threats; examples include a veteran knight, master duelist, powerful mage, apex predator, elder beast, or major supernatural threat
      Boss = overwhelmingly beyond elite; examples include a legendary hero, warlord, ancient guardian, archmage, dragon, titan, ancient horror, or mythic apex entity
    mainStat:
